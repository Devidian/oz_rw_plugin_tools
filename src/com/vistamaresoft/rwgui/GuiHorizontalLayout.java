/**
	A class implementing an automatic horizontal layout in which children
	GuiElement's are placed side by side.

	The first added child is placed at the left of the layout and each
	additional child is placed at the right of the previous.
	The layout automatically grows or shrinks to fit the children.
	<p>Children are added and removed with the usual addChild(GuiElement) and
	removeChild(GuiElement) methods.
	<p>The layout sets the font size of GuiLabel's, the border thickness and
	the background of GuiTextField's as well as the clickable status of all
	children when each child is added to the layout. These properties, as well
	as other visual properties, can be changed after adding the child.
	<p>The layout also sets the pivot position of each child on adding it;
	changing it is possible, but it is likely to disrupt the proper child
	placement within the layout.
	<p>The layout sets the position of each child each time the layout() is
	called; setting those position manually has no effect.
 * <p><b>Important</b>: due to the way Rising World plug-ins are loaded,
 * <b>this class cannot instantiated or used in any way</b> from within the onEnable()
 * method of a plug-in, as it is impossible to be sure that, at that moment,
 * the RWGui plug-in has already been loaded.
 * <p>The first moment one can be sure that all plug-ins have been loaded, and
 * it is safe to use this class, is when (or after) the first player connects
 * to the server (either dedicated or local).
