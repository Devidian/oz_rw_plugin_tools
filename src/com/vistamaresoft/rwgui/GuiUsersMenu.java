/**
 * A sub-class of GuiMenu, displaying a list of all the players known to the
 * world (i.e. all the players who has connected at least once, not only the
 * players connected at the moment).
 * <p>The menu displays the names of the player as clickable items.
 * <p>Upon a click event, the menu reports to the callback object with an <i>id</i>
 * parameter equal to the player DB ID and a String <i>data</i> parameter  with
 * the name of the player.
 * <p>For the rest, a GuiUsersMenu is managed exactly like a regular GuiMenu.
 * <p><b>Important</b>: due to the way Rising World plug-ins are loaded,
 * <b>this class cannot instantiated or used in any way</b> from within the onEnable()
 * method of a plug-in, as it is impossible to be sure that, at that moment,
 * the RWGui plug-in has already been loaded.
 * <p>The first moment one can be sure that all plug-ins have been loaded, and
 * it is safe to use this class, is when (or after) the first player connects
 * to the server (either dedicated or local).

	 *						and his own name should not appear in the list.
	 *						Use -1 to not exclude any player.
